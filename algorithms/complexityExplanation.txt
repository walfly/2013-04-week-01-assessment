List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic complexity. Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.

algorithmic complexity is a measure of the number operations required by the algorithm. 

examples, 
	a completely unpruned decision tree would be n^n
	a single each function has complexity of n
	a nested each has a complexity of n^2
	operations that remain constant as n changes operate in constant time
	logorithmic functions vary less as n grows
	etc.
